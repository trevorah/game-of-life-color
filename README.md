Game of Life (with Color!)
==========================

![it makes rainbows!](example.gif)

Play with [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), but with a twist! Every new cell inherits its color from its parents (along with a slight color mutation).

The rules are still the standard set of rules:
> 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
> 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
> 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
> 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
